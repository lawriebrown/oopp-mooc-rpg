# Lawrie's Simple Text Adventure Game package.

Contains a set of classes to implement a text-based adventure game.
To play a new instance of the game, create a new `World` instance
(optionally passing in a customized game_config data structure),
and then call the play method on that instance. eg.

  import rpg
  game_world = rpg.World()
  game_world.play()
